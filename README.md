## To do

I thought I already would have written something here, but I suppose not.

* Set up cloudflare, and configure its ssl certificates.
* set up route53, move from godaddy for jerichoblog
* set tabs as separate pages, now that I know this can be done with the same interface
* move tabs to the navbar section? (no... needs differnt focus
* Identify the information that you want to put on your front page.
* Continue for your other pages. Connect and mount your old laptop hard drive to the desktop and dig out the original homepage scheming.
