## To do

I thought I already would have written something here, but I suppose not.

* get jabber working for dbond@jabber.dbond.cc
* set up route53 with the www thing
* put something more interesting in the bottom
* set up piwik to see visiting statistics
* make \*.txt visible through apache
* write a privacy policy for piwik, and add opt-out
* set tabs as separate pages, now that I know this can be done with the same interface
* Identify the information that you want to put on your front page.
* Continue for your other pages. Connect and mount your old laptop hard drive to the desktop and dig out the original homepage scheming.
